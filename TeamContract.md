# Communication:
- Discord will be used as the main platform for communication
- For messages regarding the entire group, acknowledgement should come from everybody within 3 days, unless otherwise specified
- No specific timing for individual message, but a consistent attempt to respond timely is expected
- Communicate inability to fulfill a deadline/obligation with ample time in advance relative to the scope of the obligation (min 2 days)
- Every sunday, everyone sends a short message updating progress on individual parts (even if no news, for accountability)
- Sick team members should focus on getting better, and try to indicate ahead of time if possible, or as soon as they can after they recover

# Accountability:
- Work will be divided into smaller portions and each member will finish their assigned part
- If a member is struggling, another teammate can join their part and assumes shared accountability (if communicated properly)
- Everybody is accountable for all code they contribute
- If further assistance is required regarding accountability issues, we will consult with TA/Course email

# Decision making:
- When a group member pitches an idea, the other 5 members will have a vote, and the motion will be moved by a majority vote.

# Conflict Resolution:
- Conflicts will be resolved by measured discussion between members
- Small (inter-member) disagreements will be brought to the larger (impartial) segment of the group for a majority vote if necessary
- Larger disagreements require a 50%+1 vote for resolution
- If otherwise unable to resolve the conflict, conflicts are left to duel of format proposed by the challenged party and agreed to by both.

# General section:
- Hard work and civility is expected within the group
- Attendance not required, given weekly update is provided
- Try to follow a consistent and popular code format

# Team Member Signatures:

Lucas Helme, Tiger Zhang, Loago Zambe, Jiawei Gu, Tai Poole
